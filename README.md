# Important

Hey guys!

It was my first time using DBT so I took some classes and did everything using databricks, AWS and snowflake.

I didn't found anything on how to run python scripts to create databases on DBT so I used snowflake and SQL for this exercise but since the case was asking for a python code I also left a python script here on how I would create this database using it.

Hope everything goes right, I really loved to build this case and I'm excited about this opportunity.

To talk a little bit more about my work, here's a recommendation letter that my ex-manager wrote for me:

"Julia is one of the most value-driven people I've had the pleasure to work with. Her proficiency in handling data is enormous, she is unique in her ability to find value opportunities and present them in the most effective way possible. She grows even stronger in challenging environments, and I've seen her effortlessly handle any data stack - Excel, SQL, R, Python, Git, Airflow - you name it. Technical and business acumen is not her only feat. She is a great team player and definitely an inspiration to everyone around her. After leading her for over 2 years, I have no doubt Julia is someone I would recommend to any team!"
